This article explores different approaches to solving a CTF challenge authored by Thomas Nguyen, a software engineer, web development hobbyist, and application security enthusiast.

The approaches taken were:

- [Self-reference Attributes](#self-reference)
- [Brute Force](#brute-force)
- [Hash Cracking](#hash-cracking)
- [Magic Hashing](#magic-hashing)
- [Prototype Pollution](#prototype-pollution)

The CTF runs in a single port at [http://164.152.23.94:3000/][Website], so there's no need to launch `nmap` for port scanning.

The code can be found at [https://github.com/tthn0/TempCTF][Github].

<h4>Overview</h4>

When first navigating to the URL we are greeted with a message.

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/homepage.png">
</div>

Let's launch Burpsuite to intercept all the requests.

Go to the Proxy -> Intercept tab, turn on the Intercept, and open the Browser.

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/burp_intercept.png">
</div>

Navigate to [http://164.152.23.94:3000/][Website] again and with the request proxied send it to the Repeater to manipulate it.

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/repeater.png">
</div>

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/get_homepage.png">
</div>

The application asks us to send a POST request to `/user` or `/admin`.

Let's do just that, starting with `/user`.

Change the HTTP verb, the URL path, and send again.

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/post_user.png">
</div>

`/user` attempts to give us a flag but it's undefined.

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/post_admin.png">
</div>

`/admin` returns `You shall not pass`, which implies we don't have admin privileges.

Let's take a look at some code.

<div class="article-code">
{% highlight js %}
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
{% endhighlight %}
<p>server.js</p>
</div>

The express application parses the incoming requests with JSON payloads.

<div class="article-code">
{% highlight js %}
app.post("/user", (req, res) => {
  const user = new User(req.body);
  res.end(user.message);
});

app.post("/admin", (req, res) => {
  const admin = new Admin(req.body);
  res.end(admin.message);
});
{% endhighlight %}
<p>server.js</p>
</div>

Each endpoint sends the body of the request to its respective class.

<div class="article-code">
{% highlight js %}
class User {
  constructor(attributes) {
    // Don't allow the `isAdmin` attribute to be tampered with
    if (attributes.isAdmin) {
      this.message = "Nice try, buddy.";
      return;
    }
{% endhighlight %}
<p>user.js</p>
</div>

The application checks for an `isAdmin` attribute inside the payload. If this one is set to true it sets the message attribute of the User class instance to `Nice try, buddy.`

We can corroborate this by sending a request.

Eliminate all unnecessary headers and add `Content-Type: application/json` plus our JSON.

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/isAdmin.png">
</div>

<div class="article-code">
{% highlight js %}
    // If `attributes` contains a `flag` key, then the user is requesting the flag
    if (attributes.flag) {
      this.flag = FLAG;
    }

    // For non-admins, set instance attributes
    for (const key in attributes) {
      if (new.target === User || !this.isAdmin) {
        this[key] = attributes[key];
      }
    }

    // Update the message based on the provided password
    if (this.password === PASSWORD) {
      this.isAdmin = true;
      this.message = "You're an admin. Try the `/admin` route instead.";
    } else {
      this.message = `Welcome, user. The flag is: ${this.flag}`;
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>user.js</p>
</div>

From glancing at the code, we would think that by passing a `flag` attribute in the body we would get the flag.

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/flag_attribute.png">
</div>

But the real flag is overwritten by our value due to this for loop:

<div class="article-code">
{% highlight js %}
    // For non-admins, set instance attributes
    for (const key in attributes) {
      if (new.target === User || !this.isAdmin) {
        this[key] = attributes[key];
      }
    }
{% endhighlight %}
<p>user.js</p>
</div>

The code checks if either the instance is created from the User class (`new.target === User`), or the user is not an admin (`!this.isAdmin`).

If either condition is true, it allows all attributes from the payload to be assigned to the instance (`this[key] = attributes[key]`)

This overwrites the original `this.flag = FLAG` value.

So here is where our first idea comes into play...

<h4 id="self-reference">Self-reference Attributes</h4>

What if we could make the value of the flag attribute reference itself?

In other words, send a payload like the following:

<div class="article-code">
{% highlight py %}
{
  "flag": this.flag
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/flag_this.png">
</div>

But this of course doesn't work because it is not possible to self-reference values in a JSON declaration.

JSON is typically for data transfer, it has no idea what `this`, functions, or Dates are.

Even if we try passing `null`, an empty object (`{}`), or an empty string (`""`), it would still not work.

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/flag_null.png">
</div>

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/flag_object.png">
</div>

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/flag_empty_string.png">
</div>

<h4 id="brute-force">Brute Force</h4>

It's rarely the author's intention to make a CTF brute-forceable.

Brute force relies on luck, computational resources, and almost zero problem-solving.

Nevertheless, this application has no rate limiting implemented, so in theory, it's brute-forceable. Specifically, this part of the code:

<div class="article-code">
{% highlight js %}
// Update the message based on the provided password
if (this.password === PASSWORD) {
  this.isAdmin = true;
  this.message = "You're an admin. Try the `/admin` route instead.";
} else {
  this.message = `Welcome, user. The flag is: ${this.flag}`;
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

To do this, go into Burpsuite and pass the request to Intruder. Wrap the password value in payload markers and configure your password list in the Payloads settings tab.

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/intruder.png">
</div>

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/payload_setting.png">
</div>

To illustrate this, I have launched the CTF in localhost and changed the password in the environment file to `super_secret_password`.

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/env.png">
  <p>.env</p>
</div>

When we run the attack we get the following responses:

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/sniper_attack.png">
</div>

Notice that the length of the response for the payload `super_secret_password` differs from the rest. We get the message `You're an admin. Try the '/admin' route instead.`

In reality, the only leverage we would obtain from correctly guessing the password is the ability to be an admin. This <strong>does not</strong> include being able to display the flag, because as mentioned earlier, the for loop inside the User class would still cause the real flag to be overwritten.

<h4 id="hash-cracking">Hash Cracking</h4>

<div class="article-code">
{% highlight js %}
class Admin extends User {
  // This is the hash of something super secret
  #SECRET_HASH = "0e017509330106083103990269772661";

  constructor(attributes) {
    // Call the `User` constructor
    super(attributes);

    // Check if a password was provided (`this.password` will be null if tampering was detected)
    if (!this.password) {
      this.message = "You shall not pass.";
      return; 
    }

    // Hash the provided password
    const hash = crypto.createHash("md5").update(this.password).digest("hex");

    // Compare the hashes
    if (hash == this.#SECRET_HASH) {
      this.isAdmin = true;
    }

    // Update the message based on the provided password
    if (this.isAdmin) {
      this.message = `Welcome, admin. The flag is: ${this.flag}.`;
    } else {
      this.message = "You are not an admin. Try the `/user` route instead.";
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>admin.js</p>
</div>

Hash cracking is only viable in this CTF challenge because we have access to the source code. An external attacker who can only interact with the endpoints would not be able to perform this, since they wouldn't have visibility into the hardcoded hashes.

Looking at the Admin class, there's an MD5 hash assigned to a `SECRET_HASH` variable. We can take this hash for offline cracking using [hashcat][Hashcat].

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/hashcat_md5.png">
</div> 

Using `-m 0` as the [hash-mode][Hash-Mode] for MD5 and `rockyou.txt` as the wordlist we can craft the command.

<div class="article-code">
{% highlight sh %}
jeanp@~$ cat secret_hash.hash 
0e017509330106083103990269772661
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="article-code">
{% highlight sh %}
jeanp@~$ hashcat -m 0 secret_hash.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -o cracked_hash.hash
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

With `rockyou.txt` this hash doesn't crack, but if the password is weak enough it's a matter of trial an error.

After finding a match for the hash we can send a request with the correct password, granting us admin privileges, but not the flag.

<h4 id="magic-hashing">Magic Hashing</h4>

A [magic hash attack][Magic Hash Attack] occurs when two different values result in hashes that are treated as equal due to the use of a loosely typed `==` operator, and the hash starts with `0e` followed by numbers.

The application hashes our password and compares it against the `SECRET_HASH`.

<div class="article-code">
{% highlight js %}
// Compare the hashes
if (hash == this.#SECRET_HASH) {
  this.isAdmin = true;
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

Using PHP we get the following:

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/php_comparision.png">
</div>

This works because PHP treats strings starting with `0e` as scientific notation.

`0e0175...` is interpreted as `0 × 10^0175 = 0`.

Using `==` instead of `===` allows type juggling.

But of course, this application doesn't use PHP, and in Javascript this works a little differently.

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/magic_hash_js.png">
</div>

The output is `false`. Thus safer than PHP.

The only way this would work is if one side of the comparison is the integer `0`.

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/type_juggling_js.png">
</div>

But passing an integer into the comparison is impossible due to how our password gets hashed.

<div class="article-code">
{% highlight js %}
// Hash the provided password
const hash = crypto.createHash("md5").update(this.password).digest("hex");
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/digest_return_type.png">
  <p>Node.js documentation</p>
</div>

`hash.digest([encoding])` will always return a string.

And even if this was successful, the for loop would still prevent the real flag from being shown.

<h4 id="prototype-pollution">Prototype Pollution</h4>

So it's now clear that we must manipulate the for loop inside the User class.

<div class="article-code">
{% highlight js %}
// For non-admins, set instance attributes
for (const key in attributes) {
  if (new.target === User || !this.isAdmin) {
    this[key] = attributes[key];
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

We must call the application from the `/admin` route and set `isAdmin` to true to prevent `new.target === User` and `!this.isAdmin` from evaluating to true.

Every object in Javascript has a prototype, the object inherits properties and methods from it.

[Prototype Pollution][Prototype Pollution] would allow us to pass prototype properties from one object to another.

With the application launched in localhost let's put some print statements and watch the `isAdmin` property at various stages of the code.

<div class="article-code">
{% highlight js %}
class User {
constructor(attributes) {

console.log('attributes.isAdmin:', attributes.isAdmin); // undefined
console.log('attributes.__proto__.isAdmin:', attributes.__proto__.isAdmin, '\n'); // true

if (attributes.isAdmin) {
  this.message = "Nice try, buddy.";
  return;
}

if (attributes.flag) {
  this.flag = FLAG;
}

console.log('this.isAdmin before loop:', this.isAdmin); // undefined
console.log('this.__proto__.isAdmin before loop:', this.__proto__.isAdmin, '\n'); // undefined

// For non-admins, set instance attributes
for (const key in attributes) {
  if (new.target === User || !this.isAdmin) {
    this[key] = attributes[key];
  }
}

console.log('this.isAdmin after loop:', this.isAdmin); // true
console.log('this.__proto__.isAdmin after loop:', this.__proto__.isAdmin); // true

// Update the message based on the provided password
if (this.password === PASSWORD) {
...
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

I put 6 print statements for the `isAdmin` property.

Now send a POST request with the correct JSON prototype pollution payload.

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/portswigger_pp.png">
  <p>PortSwigger documentation</p>
</div>

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/proto_post.png">
</div>

<div class="article-image">
  <img src="/assets/img/tempctf/is_admin_prints.png">
</div>

Admin privileges get set in the instance's properties by passing them from the attributes object thanks to prototype pollution.

To get the flag we would then need to:

1. Make a POST request to `/admin`.

2. Send a `password` key-value pair in the payload and iterate until `this.password` is set in our instance to avoid the return statement in the Admin class when no password is found.

3. Iterate until `this.isAdmin` is set to `true` in our instance with prototype pollution.

4. Send a `flag` key in the payload and exit the loop to prevent `this.flag` from being overwritten.

To achieve this, send the payload with the keys and values in the correct order.

<div class="article-code">
{% highlight py %}
{
  "password": "abc",
  "__proto__":  {
    "isAdmin":true
    },
  "flag":"abc"
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
